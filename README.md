# Improved-CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm

Used two methods to calculate time quantum and analyse these methods for different cases and conclude by looking at the results. Looked how these algorithms work for different process times and asses how both of them work. I propose these two improved round robin algorithms and show how much more efficient these are. I will show that my proposed algorithm performs better than the RR algorithm, by reducing context switching, average waiting and average turnaround time.
